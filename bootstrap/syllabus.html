          <p>Chemistry is an <span class="text-info">essential course for becoming a scientifically literate citizen.</span>  While learning about the physical world at the molecular level you will also begin to think like a chemist. As you are asked to draw your own conclusions and identify patterns and relationships you will not only gain a deeper understanding of the molecular world, but also <span class="text-info">develop your reasoning, your analytical skills and your independent learning abilities.</span>  You will <span class="text-info">strengthen your ability to generate, evaluate and effectively communicate scientific knowledge</span> by conducting experiments and analyzing current scientific topics and other claims.  This course aligns with the Virginia Standards of Learning.  All students will take the Virginia <span class="text-info">SOL Chemistry exam</span> during the spring of 2014.

                  <p>A flipped class can mean many different things. In just about all cases it means that class time is primarily spent working through problems or doing hands-on activities in which students are engaged with the material instead of being lectured to. The teacher's role has changed from presenter of information to facilitator, learning coach, and tutor.  So instead of standing at the front and telling my students what they need to know, I am walking around answering their questions, directing them to various activities, adding additional explanation, asking probing questions - getting to work with each student individually. In my class information is presented to students using either video lectures, inquiry based activities, discovery labs, simulations, or reading. Almost all of it can be done in or out of class. (Labs, obviously, can only be done in class.)</p>

                  <p>My classroom is a little different than a traditional classroom...I will give you a packet. You will work thorugh the packet like it is a workbook or a tutorial. Each day certain pages are assigned and you should complete those.  If you don't - the rest becomes homework or you need to find a time to come in and work on it with my support. You will know what to do each day because the calendar lists the pages assigned. As you work through the packet you will check your answers with answer keys posted online or in the classroom. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The packets are self-explanatory. Answer the questions. Watch the videos. Take the notes. Do the assignments / labs. Participate in any group activities. If any of it doesn't work for you I am open to discussing alternatives! You can ask me for another option or make-up one yourself. If more than one option is given - pick the one that will challenge but not overwhelm. Ask questions. Check your work with answer keys. In this way you will monitor your learning and know what you need to practice and what you have mastered.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes a lab will be assigned.  If it is a class lab you will complete this with the class whether you are ready to or not. Obviousy, it is best to stay on schedule for this reason. If it is an individual or partner lab, you will complete it when you get to it. </p>

                  <p>Ask questions of me or others whenever you have them! I'll be wandering around looking to help you if you get stuck or just wonder about something. </p>

                    <p>Each day you should come to class, choose somewhere to <span class="text-success">sit/stand that is far from distraction</span>.  Check the board or calendar in the packet for the day's assignments and <span class="text-success">begin working wherever you left off.</span> Make an effort to <span class="text-success">ask questions </span> and <span class="text-success">check your work </span> as you go.  Learn from your mistakes. </p>

                  <p>Finish the packet before the test date.  I always plan one day for review. Sometimes we may do this as a whole class group. At the end of the packet is a study guide. Use it! See below for my recommendations for studying.  If you don't finish the packet before the test date - finish it within 3 days. Take the test when you are ready. Taking longer than 3 days means your quarter grade will likely be significantly impacted for the worse becuase you will not be able to catch up by the end of the quarter. See the grading information section for more on what happens at the end of the quarter. </p>

                    <p>My goal is to teach students in a way that lasts - a way that results in their being able to rationalize and think at the molecular level, to think how a chemist would think and to be able to apply those principles to their own lives.  In order to do that I strongly believe students have to take responsibility for their learning. They have to engage with the material and think about the problems and they need the time to do this at their own pace. I want all of my students to feel confident that they can understand chemistry no matter if their strengths lie in the science and math realm or if they lie in the arts and humanities.  As the human race evolves and as we find out more about how we and the Earth interact there will be many problems that require creative solutions; not just engineering solutions, but solutions that address all the facets of life on earth: social, political, etc.   It is my intention to help educate the next group of problem solvers so that they have the background knowledge, the confidence and the creativity to help us innovate our way to a successful future.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                      <p>In the past, it has been endlessly frustrating to have kids ask me to repeat a whole lecture because it went too fast for them, to see the student whose eyes glaze over in the middle of your lecture and who will likely lose out because he or she was thinking of something else just then and there is no way to rewind the teacher and hear it again. The skills of realizing you don't know something and making the effort to go find out seemed to be foreign to many students.  Or maybe students are just afraid to say they don't know something, or worse, maybe they just don't know how to find out what they don't know.</p>

                      <p>To learn science takes more than listening to a lecture, it takes time mulling over the concepts, trying to figure them out on your own, looking for patterns and associations that help you organize them in a way that leads to deep understanding.  I want to provide the opportunity to do that for my students and when I saw this video - I was inspired to make it happen in my classroom.</p>

                <p>A test date is scheduled accordnig to when I think you should be able to make it through a unit.  You can choose to take the test that day or another day. However, you should try to take the test within 3 days. More than that and you will have difficulty finishing all of the tests before the end of the quarter. </p>
                
                <p>Your grade is not lowered if you take a test late. However, if you do not take a test before the end of the quarter, I'll put a big ugly 0 in the grade book for it. Try not to do that.  In fact, it is unlikely that you will do this.  The most likely thing is that you will take the last quiz of the quarter on the last day possible and not have finished all of the required work. You probably won't do well on this quiz/test.Try not to do that either because it can set you up for difficulty in future units.</p>

                <p>Best practice research indicates that grading should utilize standards and allow for student growth. Therefore, I use a system that grades by learning objective or skill. For example, if you scored only a D on the moles topic, but an A on nomenclature, we would know that you needed more work on moles and could retake that quiz, but had mastered nomenclature. Averaging the two scores to come up with a grade for a test that included both topics wouldn't provide enough information about how you were doing.</p>

                <p>Research also shows that grades need to be meaningful. What is a meaningful grade? A grade that provides information about the level at which a student is currently performing.  A 4 to 0 scale is paramount for the success of this because I need a consistent way of determining and communicating student performance levels.  It gives me a framework for designing tests and quizzes so that I am really measuring at what level a student understands something rather than just how many points a student can accumulate by showing how many bits of (perhaps unrelated) knowledge they have. </p>

                <p> Furthermore, my goal is for students to focus their attention on learning and mastering chemistry concepts rather than on grades. Chemistry is a subject that builds on itself.  As we progress throughout the year, students will still need to remember material learned in the first few weeks. With that in mind I have developed a course that allows students some flexibility in pacing and flexibility in testing (retakes, alternative assessments).   </p>

                <p>Tests can be retaken. The new test grade will be averaged in with old test grades. To retake a tst you must write the test yourself.  Check it with me so I can give you feedback about areas you are missing questions.  Once you have finalized a test, schedule a time to come in and take it.  This is a great opportunity to show me that you really do know the concepts and have mastered them.  I'm not going to lie - it's a lot of work, but you will learn ALOT doing it! </p>
